# AIception

This project demonstrates how to create a simple image classification model using PyTorch to distinguish between cats and dogs. 
The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.
The code was mostly generated by AI - ChatGPT 3.5 as an experiment.
The project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and reaches 74.6% accuracy.
For training and evaluation the [Microsoft Cats vs. Dogs Dataset](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54765) has been used.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Directory containing the training dataset.
    - `train/`: Subdirectories for each class (cat and dog).
- `model.py`: Python script defining the neural network architecture.
- `Train.py`: Python script for training the model.
- `Evaluate.py`: Python script for evaluating the trained model on a test set.
- `10_epoch_model_74.6.pth`: Saved weights of the best-performing model.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
